										<h2>Android Weather App</h2>

										</div>
										<p>
											This is a simple weather app I developed with Java in Android Studio. It allows the user to
											input a city name and then calls a REST API to get data about the weather for that week. The JSON response is then deserialized,
											formatted, and output to the
											user as a 5-day forecast. Depending on the weather conditions returned by the JSON object, 
											the icon on the right side changes to reflect the weather conditions
											for that day. A clear day would be denoted by a sun icon, slightly cloudy with a sun behind a cloud icon, overcast with an overlapping clouds icon,
											and rain with a rain cloud icon.

										<h2>Python Web Scraper</h2>

										This program is a web scraper I wrote with python using the BeautifulSoup library. Every 8 hours, it will iterate through a list of product
										URLs (in this case product pages for trading cards) and will send an email for each product that drops 
										below a certain price, which the program gets from the html on the site. I wrote this program to use with 
										a group of friends for a trading card game we all play, since the prices for cards tend to fluctuate often, 
										so it's been really useful in a real life setting. Right now, the program is configured for this specific 
										trading card site, but it can easily be changed for ecommerce sites such as Amazon and can keep track of basically 
										any number of different products.

										<h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm Project</h2>
									</header>
									
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-50">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/DijkstraPath2.PNG" height="400" alt=""/></span></div>			
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										This is a shortest path program I developed with C++ in Visual Studio. The program takes a text file
										as input, which contains the number of nodes and edges on the first line and a list of each connecting edge with weight.
									    The program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the shortest path between two
										nodes input by the user. To create the initial map from the text file, the user 
										types "I" in the command line. The user can type "W" to output the list of nodes and edges with
										weight. So for example the line "1 : (8, 2);" means there is an edge from node 1 to node 8 with a weight of 2.
										To see the shortest path between any two nodes, if there is a path, the user
										inputs "C startNode destinationNode flag". If the flag is 0, the program will output the length
										of the shortest path. If the flag is 1, the path with node numbers will be shown. Finally, the user
										can exit the program with the command "E". This project was developed in a data structures and algorithms
										class I took at ASU, so I have made the github repository private so current students can't use it.

										<h2>Midoriya Sushi</h2>

										This project is a website for a fictional sushi restaurant called Midoriya Sushi. It was made using 
										HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript. It has a home page with sections that give an overview of the restaurant,
										including pictures of the various types of sushi they serve. The rest of the pages for the navigation tabs
										haven't been made, aside from the Menu tab which redirects the user to the restaurant menu page. It's hosted
										on github pages, so you can click the link below to see the site.
